# Inspiration
Truthfully, I am not the creative type of person. That is why when I heard Mr Lam announce the WA2 assignment, I was perplexed. It was one of the first times in my life that I had the liberty to choose the topic of any major assignment. I did not know what to do, I did not know what to choose. As the deadline for selecting the type of web app I was going to make drew nearer and nearer, I was getting more and more nervous. I was running out of time. I decided to ask my friends what they decided to do themselves. Some chose to make an exam planner while others chose study trackers. While all of these concepts sounded interesting, none of them truly resonated with me. I wanted to make something that would help me as well as my peers. I did not want to do this solely for the weighted assessment, I wanted to do this for myself. Days and days went on and things remained the same. While more and more people were picking their assignments, I was still there, contemplating what I should do. I was just doing what I do every day until I saw a message. It was from a group chat where I don't usually see many messages. It was a group chat for school, more specifically, for H2 Computing. There, I saw Mr Lam's message. It read: "If you do not choose a topic by this time, this assignment will be fixed for you". The assignment in question is A H2 Math portal. Eureka! This was it, a way to help others as well as myself. Immediately after reading that message, I set my mind on completing the H2 Math portal regardless of how challenging it may be. 

# What it does
There are many different functions built into my web app. Firstly, there is a register and login system. Where every successful login adds the user as well as their password into a database such that for every future successive login, their profiles would remain. Next, there are four different types of quizzes. A twenty-minute one, a thirty-minute one, a forty-minute one, and a fifty-minute one. The quizzes end automatically after their respective time frames are over. Each one of these contains ten math questions with dynamic questions and answers. After finishing a quiz, you may head over to the side tab on the main page to say three different buttons. A leaderboard button, a profile button, and a logout button. The profile button would be there to check your personal top scores for a specific type of test while the leaderboard button would show you the highest scores from every collective user. After you are done doing what you want to do on the website, you may leave by pressing the logout button. Now, that was only from the student's perspectives. From the perspective of an administrator,  you would have to log in with a specific account. After you log in, you will be brought to a different page. This page would allow you to delete user profiles as well as leaderboard scores if you feel as though they do not belong. After you delete the scores, other regular users would not be able to see the scores on the leaderboard anymore and if you deleted their profiles, it would be as though the profile never existed and no one even created that account in the first place.



# How it's built
Firstly, I set up the basic structure of Flask, HTML, and CSS. Following that, I started making the main page for my website. Immediately after, I created a register and login system while also connecting it to a database. Afterward, I created the logic for the different types of exams, the leaderboard, and the profile. Finally, I created the admin portal. This code was built mainly on Visual Studio code and for the parts that I did not know how to do, I relied on Google or chatGPT for assistance.


# Challenges encountered
While there were many challenges encountered along the way, the biggest challenge I encountered was learning how to set-up a databse as well as how to retrieve information from the said database.
