# Inspiration
Truthfully, I am not the creative type of person. That is why when I heard Mr Lam announce the WA2 assignment, I was perplexed. It was one of the first times in my life where I had the liberty to choose the topic of any major assignment. I did not know what to do, I did not know what to choose. As the deadline for choosing the type of web app I was going to make drew nearer and nearer, I was getting more and more nervous. I was running out of time. I decicded to ask my friends what they decided to do themselves. Some of them chose to make an exam planner while others chose study trackers. While all of these concepts sounded interesting, none of them truly resonated with me. I wanted to make something which would actually help me as well as my peers. I did not want to do this solely for the weighted assessment, I wanted to do this for myself. Days and days went on and things remained the same. While more and more people were picking their assignments, I was still there, contemplating about what I should do. I was just doing whawt I do everyday until I saw a message. It was from a groupchat where I don't usually see many messages. It was a groupchat for school, more specifically, for H2 Computing. There, I saw Mr Lam's message. It read:"If you do not choose a topic by this time, this assignment would be fixed to you". The assignment in question, A H2 Math portal. Eureka! This was it, a way to help others as well as myself. Immediately after reading that message, I set my mind on completing the H2 Math portal regardless of how challenging it may be.
